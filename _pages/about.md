HiðŸ˜Š I am Qiang, a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Paris-Saclay, working under the guidance of Professors AndrÃ© Torre and Maryline Filippi.

My research interests center on regional innovation and development across various spatial scales, with a focus on the roles of multiple actors, relationships, and levels of knowledge.

In my PhD research, I investigate how diverse networks shape regional innovation and development in the seed industry. I take a multidisciplinary approach, integrating relational and spatial perspectives, and employ both quantitative and qualitative methods. My work is informed by theories such as evolutionary economic geography, relational economic geography, social network theory, proximity theory, innovation systems, cluster life cycles, global value chains, and new industrial path development.

Over the course of my PhD, I have gained extensive experience leading independent research projectsâ€”from designing studies to collecting and analyzing data. A particularly enriching experience was conducting fieldwork in China, where I gathered original data from an agricultural cluster in a peripheral region. This fieldwork honed my skills in survey and interview design, building rapport with local stakeholders, and managing complex research logistics.

My work contributes to current debates in Economic Geography. One of my papers, currently under review, examines new industrial path development from a relational perspective, shedding light on how peripheral regions can leverage network resources to foster new industrial trajectories. Another article, also under review, extends the "buzz and pipelines" framework by incorporating multiplex relations and insights from global production chains.

I am currently on the job market and open to post-doctoral fellowships or tenure-track faculty positions. Feel free to get in touch!
